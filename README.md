# superLied

WIP Lied script for SuperCollider. <br>
<br>
The grid of buttons works this way:<br>
<b>Row 1</b>: recall lines you've typed from history<br>
<b>Row 2</b>: trigger synth patterns<br>
<b>Row 3</b>: apply the active line (either the most-recently-entered one or the one you've recalled with row 1) to the pattern immediately above<br>
<b>Row 4</b>: groups of 3. Trigger sample playback, playback speed manipulation, and panning manipulation. Samples will be cut up, have their playback speed manipulated, and panned around in ways determined by the active line<br>
<b>Row 5</b>: apply the active line (either the most-recently-entered one or the one you've recalled with row 1) to the sample cutter/speed/panning slot immediately above<br>
<b>Row 6</b>: currently unused<br>
<b>Row 7</b>: currently unused<br>
<b>Row 8</b>: trigger sample playback. These samples play in their entirety and are unaffected by the active line (works nicely for drums)
