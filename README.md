# superLied

WIP Lied script for SuperCollider. <br>
<br>
Note that you'll have to load your own samples, in lines 278-329, in order for this to run properly.<br>
<br>
The grid of buttons works this way:<br>
Row 1: recall lines you've types from history<br>
Row 2: trigger synth patterns<br>
Row 3: apply the active line (either the most-recently-entered one or the one you've recalled with row 1) to the pattern immediately above<br>
Row 4: trigger sample playback. Samples will be cut up by the active line<br>
Row 5: apply the active line (either the most-recently-entered one or the one you've recalled with row 1) to the sample immediately above<br>
Row 6: currently unused<br>
Row 7: currently unused<br>
Row 8: trigger sample playback. These samples play in their entirety and are unaffected by the active line (works nicely for drums)
