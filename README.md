# superLied

WIP Lied script for SuperCollider. <br>
<br>
Note that you'll have to load your own samples, in lines 278-329, in order for this to run properly.<br>
<br>
The grid of buttons works this way:<br>
<b>Row 1</b>: recall lines you've types from history<br>
<b>Row 2</b>: trigger synth patterns<br>
<b>Row 3</b>: apply the active line (either the most-recently-entered one or the one you've recalled with row 1) to the pattern immediately above<br>
<b>Row 4</b>: trigger sample playback. Samples will be cut up by the active line<br>
<b>Row 5</b>: apply the active line (either the most-recently-entered one or the one you've recalled with row 1) to the sample immediately above<br>
<b>Row 6</b>: currently unused<br>
<b>Row 7</b>: currently unused<br>
<b>Row 8</b>: trigger sample playback. These samples play in their entirety and are unaffected by the active line (works nicely for drums)
